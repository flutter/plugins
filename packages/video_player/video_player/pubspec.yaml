  # The design on https://flutter.dev/go/federated-plugins was to leave
  # this constraint as "any". We cannot do it right now as it fails pub publish
  # validation, so we set a ^ constraint. The exact value doesn't matter since
  # the constraints on the interface pins it.
  # TODO(amirh): Revisit this (either update this part in the design or the pub tool).
